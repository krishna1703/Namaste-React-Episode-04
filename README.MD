# config Driven UI 😃

 - All the UI is the driven by config (Backend Api)
 - In a configuration-driven UI, the layout, styles, and other properties of UI elements are defined in a configuration file or database, which can be easily modified without requiring changes to the codebase. This approach makes it easier to customize the UI for different use cases or user groups, without the need for extensive coding.

 # lets talk about the Key  🙃

  - when ever you are looping anythings you have always to  give  a key 

# React don't recommend index 🤢

- react don't recommend using indexes for the keys if the order of the item may change
- index  as a key is an anti-pattern 

# Notes imp 😏
 
- not using key (not acceptable) <<<<<< Index as key <<<<<<<<< unique id (Best practice)
